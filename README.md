Mouse events are a popular way to bind the DOM elements to events. Some of these events are as follows:

click: Triggered when the mouse is clicked <br>
mousemove: Triggered when the mouse moves over an element <br>
mouseleave: Triggered when mouse the leaves an element <br>
<br>
The mouse movement event is used to update the position of the "eye" element displayed on the page.
