### **Eye Tracker** <br>
The goal of this exercise was to code the mouse tracker tp create an interactive element. The mouse movement event is used to update the position of the "eye" element displayed on the page. 

### **Description**<br>
Mouse events are a popular way to bind the DOM elements to events. Some of these events are as follows:

click: Triggered when the mouse is clicked <br>
mousemove: Triggered when the mouse moves over an element <br>
mouseleave: Triggered when mouse the leaves an element <br>

<h3>Usage<br></h3>
This code can be used to practice running a function that allows an object to follow your mouse or clicks. It creates a more interactive user experience.
